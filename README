Pollious is a Polling application written in the high-level web 
development language, Django, which I am currently learning.

Please, download and enjoy it!


Run the command: 'python manage.py runserver'
If you want to run it on another port, use: 'python manage.py runserver 
(port no.)

Browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/ to view the polls.
Browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to create/edit the polls.
The default username is: 'admin'
The default password is: 'default'

There is a default poll of 'How are you?'
Thanks, and enjoy!
